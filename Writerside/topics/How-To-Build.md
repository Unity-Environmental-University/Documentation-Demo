# How To Build

How to build the Documentation, and publish it.

We will cover how to Publish your changes and have it automatically deploy to the [Documentation Site](https://unity-environmental-university.github.io/LXD-Documentation/)

## Before you start

### Perform a **Fetch**
- It is best practice to make sure you have the latest changes before pushing.
We can do this with a "**Fetch**" command within GitHub Desktop.

Once we have the latest version, we can continue.

## Commit & Push your changes

### Making your **Commit**

With this step, we can tell others *what* we changed and *why*.

1. Title your changeset, and describe your changes
![github-commit.png](github-commit.png){ border-effect="line" thumbnail="true" width="350"}
2. Once you have made the appropriate notes, click `Commit to main`

3. Now we need to **Push** your **Commit** to the repository
![github-push.png](github-push.png){ border-effect="line" thumbnail="true" width="350"}
This will trigger a script designed to automatically build and deploy your changes to the [Live Documentation](https://unity-environmental-university.github.io/LXD-Documentation/) 
>Your changes may take up to 5 minutes to appear on the live version.
